# AI Object Detection with DETR & Transformers.js

A powerful web-based object detection application that uses state-of-the-art AI models to detect and label objects in images. This tool leverages Facebook's DETR (Detection Transformer) model through Transformers.js, providing real-time object detection directly in the browser without requiring a backend server.
