# AI Object Detection with YOLO & Transformers.js

A modern web-based object detection application that uses state-of-the-art AI models to detect and label objects in images. This tool leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) tiny model through Transformers.js, providing real-time object detection directly in the browser without requiring a backend server.

## 🌐 Live Demo
